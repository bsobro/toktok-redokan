= For what it is? =

Content is a king. This was, is and will be true in all times. Good content posts with relevate images, videos, usefull information always get tons of traffic and easy for monetization. Such posts make your site useful for visitors and increase value in search engines.

But how much time do you spend to add images, relevant videos, books, news, photos and affiliate products to post? You have to go on youtube, find videos, then on google images, flickr, amazon, twitter, google news, etc. Searching relevant additional content, formatting, adding to post takes too much time for each article. 

And what about monetization? There are tons of affiliate systems with great partnership programs. All of them have it's own good and bad sides. But, what if you want to add products from several affiliate systems? Or, for example, you want to have comparison price list with auto updated prices and products.

Good news, we solved this problem for our projects and we want to offer you the best, all in one instrument for adding additional content from open sources to your posts and best affiliate offers from different affiliate systems to make moneymaking process as easy as possible. All modules have many options to search only the best content. For example, you can enable searching only the best deals from Amazon or only products with definite price.

It's very easy to use - just insert keyword, plugin will search all available content from modules, choose items which you want to insert. That's all. Plugin can insert blocks automatically in the end, begining of post or with shortcodes. So, you can mix content from different modules with default shortcodes of your theme. Also, plugin can store images from modules to your server and even set featured image to your post.

Of course, plugin can update price and availability in affiliate modules like Amazon, etc. It's a great way to monetize your sites!
